# 960 grid template 1 example 1

This is an example of a site built using the 960-grid. 

For large displays, I've used an (almost) full-length aside on the right-hand side for the story element. For smaller displays, the aside breaks the clean feel of the design, so I hide it on viewports of 820px and below.

The site was built using HTML, CSS and SASS/SCSS. The design was styled using CSS Flexbox and Grid.
